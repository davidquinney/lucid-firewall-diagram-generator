The Lucid Standard Import offers the ability to format JSON that can be used to import shapes, lines, groups, and more into a new Lucidchart or Lucidspark board.

The Standard Import can be accessed via Lucid's Import Document REST API endpoint, where the file and title are provided through the form data. If no title is specified, the document will be automatically assigned the name of the file.

The import request has an additional required product field where the user specifies the new document's product. The two currently-supported products are lucidchart and lucidspark.

The Lucid Standard Import is evolving and over time more features may be added. If there is something missing, submit and request feedback in our Community feedback space.

Due to the evolving nature of Lucid documents, an unchanged Standard Import file may produce varying results over time.

Example file structure

â””â”€â”€ document.json
Example Import Files
Here are some .lucid ZIP file examples you can reference or use in your own projects.

Each link directs you to a folder in GitHub that contains a .lucid ZIP file, a folder containing the unzipped contents of the ZIP file, and a brief description of the example.

Example Import Usages
You can also find examples of how to use the Standard Import in the /standard-import folder in Lucid's repository of Sample Lucid REST Applications.

These examples solve some common use cases with the Standard Import. More information on how to use them "out-of-the-box" can be found in their respective README.md files.
