To import a data set from Google Sheets, Excel, or CSV with your document, include the CSV export of the file in the data directory.

To reference it from the JSON, refer to Linked Data and Collections.

Data files are referenced without including directories. To use the file email-flow.csv shown in the example file structure, the collection data source would be defined as "dataSource": "email-flow.csv", not "dataSource": "templates/email-flow.csv".
