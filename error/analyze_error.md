# Analysis of Lucid API Upload Error

## Error Message
```
API Response Status Code: 400
API Response Content: {"code":"badRequest""message":"Bad or malformed request""requestId":"91bfa6b85255938b""details":{"error":"Count: 6 message: 'w' is undefined on object. Available keys are 'x' 'y' 'width' 'heigh...
```

## Issue Analysis

The error message indicates that the API is trying to access a property named 'w' on an object, but that property doesn't exist. The available properties are 'x', 'y', 'width', and 'height' (truncated in the error message as 'heigh...').

This suggests a potential issue with how the document.json file is formatted or how the Lucid API is interpreting it.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Property Name Mismatch**: The Lucid API might be expecting a property named 'w' instead of 'width' in some objects.

2. **Position Objects Format**: In the document.json, position objects have 'x' and 'y' properties:
   ```json
   "position": {
     "x": 1,
     "y": 0.5
   }
   ```
   The API might be expecting 'w' and 'h' properties in these position objects as well.

3. **BoundingBox Format**: While our boundingBox objects use 'width' and 'height':
   ```json
   "boundingBox": {
     "x": 100,
     "y": 100,
     "width": 400,
     "height": 300
   }
   ```
   The API might be expecting 'w' and 'h' instead of 'width' and 'height'.

4. **Missing Properties**: There might be required properties missing in certain objects.

## Fix Recommendations

### Option 1: Update Property Names
Modify the `_create_az_containers` and `_create_entity_shapes` methods in `lucid_generator.py` to use 'w' and 'h' instead of 'width' and 'height' in boundingBox objects:

```python
container = {
    "id": f"az_{i+1}",
    "type": "rectangle",
    "boundingBox": {
        "x": x_position,
        "y": start_y,
        "w": container_width,  # Changed from "width"
        "h": container_height  # Changed from "height"
    },
    # ... rest of the object ...
}
```

### Option 2: Check Lucid API Documentation
Review the Lucid API documentation for the exact format expected for document.json files. The error suggests that the API is expecting a different property name than what we're providing.

### Option 3: Compare with Sample Files
If Lucid provides sample document.json files, compare our generated file with those samples to identify any format differences.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `lucid_generator.py` file to use 'w' and 'h' instead of 'width' and 'height'.
2. Test the upload again to see if the error is resolved.
3. If the error persists, examine the endpoint objects in the connection lines to ensure they're formatted correctly.
