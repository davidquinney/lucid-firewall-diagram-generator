# Lucid Generator Improvements

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Fixed AZ Container Sizing
- **Problem**: AZ rectangles were not large enough to contain all their entities, causing them to go off the edges
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased minimum container dimensions (300x300 instead of 250x250)
  - Added dynamic padding and more aggressive height calculation based on entity count
  - Applied additional height for containers with many entities (entity_count > 5)
  - Added container validation method to adjust container bounds when entities exceed them

### 2. Fixed Entity Rectangle Sizing
- **Problem**: Rectangles were too small for text, causing words to run off the sides
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented progressive width and height scaling based on text length
  - Added special handling for text with parentheses (like "NDB Server (API Server VM1)")
  - Applied more aggressive scaling for longer text (e.g., text > 40 chars gets 350px width)
  - Added 10% additional size increase for entities with parentheses in their names

### 3. Improved Line Connection Logic
- **Problem**: Connection lines weren't consistent or optimally routed between entities
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented special handling for diagonal connections (when both row and column differ)
  - Created specific rules for different diagonal types:
    - Bottom-left to top-right: both use right sides
    - Top-right to bottom-left: both use left sides
    - Top-left to bottom-right: right-to-left standard
    - Bottom-right to top-left: left-to-right standard
  - Maintained the standard horizontal/vertical connection patterns for non-diagonal routes

### 4. Fixed AZ Grid Alignment
- **Problem**: AZs like Client Network weren't aligned with the grid (off-center from Local AZ)
- **Solution**:
  - Enforced consistent grid positioning for all AZs
  - Added more predefined AZ positions for common names
  - Ensured Client Network is directly above Local AZ in same column
  - Assigned remaining AZs to consistent grid positions

### 5. Improved Arrow Distribution
- **Problem**: Arrows were clustered and not evenly distributed
- **Solution**: 
  - Used progressive distribution algorithm for multiple connections
  - Applied unique positioning for each protocol
  - Added position conflict detection and resolution
  - Implemented balanced distribution based on number of connections
  - Used varying offsets to ensure arrows don't overlap

## Testing

Test the changes with the sample diagram files:
- vscode/lucid-generator/output/sql.json
- vscode/lucid-generator/output/NDB Control Plane.json

You should see:
1. All entities are now contained within their AZ rectangles
2. Text fits properly in all entity rectangles
3. Connections follow logical patterns with consistent routing
4. Arrows are better distributed and have less clustering
